# Decorator_Design_Pattern__JAVA

This problem is a classic case for the Decorator Design Pattern.

Why Decorator Pattern?
The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In this case:

You have a base class representing a student (likely an underprivileged one).

You want to "decorate" this student with better dressing and speaking skills so they can appear elite.

Rather than changing the original class, you wrap the original student in decorators.
